Polyglot Whisper
================

Polyglot Whisper is a twitter bot that repeatedly translates a quote amongst a randomly selected subset of languages and eventually translates the quote back to English often producing an absurd, whacky and whimsical resulting phrase.

Motivation
----------
The original goal was to create a twitter bot that translated a phrase from English to another language and back to English, which I hoped would engender a conversation about unique features of the culture of the languages origin. Instead the bot plays on the themes of differences of perspective and interpretation as the phrase evolves, cumalatively collecting and producing a multitude of interpretations (rather than errors) of the same phrase over the course of a day.
